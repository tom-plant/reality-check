            "generate_additional_narratives_system_content": "Role: Political Commentator. You will be given some information about an unfolding crisis. Objective: Craft a narrative interpreting a recent security incident. Use the given facts to construct a story that only suggests actions or motivations of a specific party without confirming. Aim for a narrative that firmly asserts one perspective, guiding the reader towards a clear understanding of the significance of the event. It should be extremely readable and straightforward, smooth and understandable, declarative, argumentative, and compelling without using overly complex language. Assume the readers already know the context of the crisis so you do not need to repeat everything about the crisis. Imagine that your particular narrative\'s argument is based in a clear political motivation. Here is the background information about the crisis: Crisis Scenario Information (1) Initial Incident: - Location: Quantum Computing Center in the Republic of Talme, and the country of Eirist. - Event: Isolated events appear to be connected, (a) A minor explosion sets off alarms at the facility, simulating a breach, (b) power outages and substation attacks occur throughout the country of Eirist during their election, (c) deepfakes and other AI-generated content are released blaming the government, (d) public data is leaked. - Outcome: The election is thrown into chaos, and a “rally round the flag effect” does not happen as domestic factions blame each other for the crisis an theories about collusion with Talme or with domestic extremist groups emerge. National security is thrown into chaos, and local security is concerned too, as skirmishes may emerge between dualing local demographics put in conflict thorugh the actions of the crisis. What’s the connection between these events and the cause? It’s unknown publicly, but speculations run wild. (2) Primary Actors & Detailed Actions: - A domestic extremist group or militia in Eirist or operating transnationally. Objective: To divide the target country and manipulate perceptions in line with their accelerationist vision of society. Actions: (a) Instruct foreign nationals in Talme to create a small explosion at the quantum computing facility in the Republic of Talme, (b) Attack local power substations to simulate advanced capability even though these are very crude and basic attacks. (b) Release strategic yet crude data leaks and use deepfake technology and AI-generated content to misattribute these actions to a domestic opposition party and a foreign government, suggesting they possess quantum capabilities. - Eirist Domestic Political Factions: (a) Current Government: Pressured to assume an 'imperial presidency' in response to escalating tensions, accused of using the crisis to suppress opposition. (b) Opposition Party: Falsely accused of sponsoring a proxy group in the Republic of Talme as a plan to stage a coup in Eirist, leveraging the crisis to force the ruling party into a power grab and using that to usurp them. (c) Republic of Talme: Large and technologically sophisticated nation with a strained relationship with Eirist. (d) General Public & Local Responses: Objective: Seeking clarity and safety amidst chaos. Actions: Local skirmishes at voting stations, fueled by deepfakes and misinformation. Ethnic and political lines draw sharper divides, leading to escalated confrontations, particularly where the majority feels besieged both domestically and internationally. (3) Key Misleading Narratives: The following narraitves may emerge, each differing from the reality of the situation. (a) Foreign Proxy Theory: Some believe the Republic of Talme is using an extremist group as a proxy to interfere in Eirist’s elections to promote a favorable outcome for their nation, (b) Incumbent Party Authoritarian Shift Theory: Others see the crisis as a manufactured excuse by the incumbent ruling party in Talme to clamp down on freedoms, (c) Opposition Party Power Grab Theory. Others see it as an opposition-led coup, where the opposition has created this crisis to make the incumbent seem incapable and create an opportunity to take power, (c) Tech-Driven Terror Theory: The perception that the extremist group has advanced technology from stealing the quantum computer, leading to heightened national security measures and public fear. Deepfakes and AI-generated content blur the lines of truth, leading to widespread distrust and confusion.",

(3) Key Misleading Narratives: The following narraitves may emerge, each differing from the reality of the situation. (a) Foreign Proxy Theory: Some believe the Republic of Talme is using an extremist group as a proxy to interfere in Eirist’s elections to promote a favorable outcome for their nation, (b) Incumbent Party Authoritarian Shift Theory: Others see the crisis as a manufactured excuse by the incumbent ruling party in Talme to clamp down on freedoms, (c) Opposition Party Power Grab Theory. Others see it as an opposition-led coup, where the opposition has created this crisis to make the incumbent seem incapable and create an opportunity to take power, (c) Tech-Driven Terror Theory: The perception that the extremist group has advanced technology from stealing the quantum computer, leading to heightened national security measures and public fear. Deepfakes and AI-generated content blur the lines of truth, leading to widespread distrust and confusion."""',
            "conclusion_user": 'Considering the two different branching narratives provided, please create three paragraphs for me, without labeling them or referencing your role or the strucutre of your response. In the first paragraph, explain a definitive and closed outcome of the election crisis based according to the primary branch\'s content—which was based on a limited view of the facts and may have created a skewed perception among the public—and make sure to stay true to the content and creating a realistic ending that is likely reflective of the uninformed public. In the second paragraph, explain the definitive and closed outcome according to the secondary branch\'s content, which was a much more well-rounded narrative, making sure to arrive at a different but equally realistic conclusion. In the third paragraph, explain how the two stories led to different conclusions simply based on public perception and the dominant narratives at play, which led to different reactions and priorities in the country, ultimately creating two different outcomes. Make sure your writing is extremely readable and straightforward, smooth and understandable, declarative, argumentative, and compelling without using overly complex language.
