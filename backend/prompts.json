        "c - Complement the reader's worldview by reassuring them that the misinformation is false and the truth aligns with their interests.

      "Government Power: Government Consolidates Power: If the public and international community accept the government's narrative, the ruling party successfully consolidates power under the emergency measures, potentially leading to a more authoritarian regime.",

With the nation paralyzed by uncertainty and the risk of civil conflict escalating, international bodies might step in to mediate, possibly leading to a transitional government or new elections under international supervision.",
      "Peace: Peace Achieved: If a corrected narrative prevails, supported by public and international consensus, Eirist could achieve a sustainable peace by identifying the Republic of Talme as the attacker, neutralizing the threat, and resuming a free and fair election that leads to a peaceful maintence of power or transfer of power to the opposition.",
      "Civil Conflict: Escalation into Civil Conflict: If the situation continues to deteriorate, with the government and opposition unable to assert control, Eirist could spiral into a civil conflict, with various factions vying for power amidst the chaos."
